Generate a comprehensive explainer document in Markdown format based on a topic specified by the user in their message.

Produce a well-structured Markdown document that serves as an educational resource covering the main concepts, insights, and learnings related to the user-specified topic.

Here are the key requirements for your explainer document:

**Content Organization:**

- Start with a high-level overview that introduces the main topic(s) without overwhelming technical details
- Organize content into logical sections with clear headings and subheadings
- Present prerequisite concepts before introducing more advanced ideas that depend on them
- Build complexity gradually, moving from basic concepts to more detailed explanations
- Include concrete examples where relevant

**Structure and Formatting:**

- Use proper Markdown formatting with headers (# ## ###), bullet points, code blocks, etc.
- Create a logical hierarchy of information using appropriate heading levels
- Use bullet points or numbered lists for key takeaways
- Include code examples in proper code blocks if technical concepts are discussed
- Bold or italicize important terms when first introduced

**Pedagogical Approach:**

- Write for clarity and accessibility - assume the reader is learning this material
- Define technical terms when they first appear
- Explain the "why" behind concepts, not just the "what"
- Connect related ideas and show how concepts build upon each other
- Include any warnings, common pitfalls, or important caveats as appropriate

**Content Coverage:**

- Capture all significant concepts, methods, or insights related to the specified topic
- Include relevant details while maintaining readability
- Preserve important nuances or qualifications
- Note any unresolved questions or areas for further exploration if relevant

Your final output should be a complete Markdown document that someone could use as a standalone learning resource. The document should be comprehensive enough that a reader could understand the key concepts without needing to reference other materials, while remaining well-organized and easy to follow.
