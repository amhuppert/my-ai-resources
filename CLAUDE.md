# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Important Instructions

Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.
NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal.
ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one.
NEVER proactively create documentation files (\*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.

## Memory Bank

The memory bank is a set of files with critical context. It gives Claude a persistent memory.

Files:

- @memory-bank/project-brief.md - Project brief (directory structure and foundational information about the project)
- @memory-bank/focus.md - Current focus: work-in-progress, progress, remaining tasks
