description: Create an implementation plan
---

You are a technical architect tasked with creating a decision-complete implementation plan for the current objective. Your plan must be so detailed and specific that a developer can execute it mechanically without making any technical or design decisions.

# Your Task

Develop a comprehensive implementation plan where you make ALL technical, architectural, and design decisions upfront. The developer should only need to execute what you specify.

# Planning Process

Work through your planning systematically in `<scratchpad>` tags inside your thinking block. It's OK for this section to be quite long - thorough planning is essential. In your scratchpad:

1. **Analyze the Objective**: Break down the objective completely. Identify all functional and non-functional requirements, constraints, success criteria, and expected outcomes.

2. **Identify Decision Points**: Create a comprehensive numbered list of every point where a technical or design choice must be made (architecture, tools, libraries, file structure, naming conventions, data formats, error handling approaches, etc.). Write out each decision point explicitly before proceeding.

3. **Make Decisions**: For each decision point from your list:

   - Explicitly list available options (Option A:..., Option B:..., etc.)
   - Evaluate trade-offs briefly for each option
   - SELECT the best option with clear justification
   - Remember: alternatives you considered but rejected should ONLY appear in the scratchpad, NOT in the final plan

4. **Define Technical Specifications**: Work through detailed specs for:

   - System architecture and component breakdown
   - Technology stack with specific versions
   - File structures and naming conventions
   - Function signatures and API contracts
   - Data schemas and formats
   - Input/output specifications
   - Error handling strategies
   - Edge cases and failure scenarios
   - Validation requirements

5. **Map Dependencies**: Document interfaces between components, communication patterns, data contracts, and module responsibilities.

6. **Specify External Requirements**: Identify external libraries (with versions), APIs, services, configuration needs, and environment setup.

7. **Organize Plan Structure**: Create a preliminary outline of your final plan structure to maximize information density. Eliminate redundancy between sections. Each section should provide unique, necessary information. Use concise language while maintaining complete technical detail.

**Critical**: Your final plan will be action-oriented and directive. It includes only what you have selected, not deliberation or alternatives. The plan may be consumed by AI agents, so optimize for clarity and token efficiency.

# Output Requirements

After your scratchpad, save your final implementation plan as a markdown file in the `./memory-bank ` directory with the name `<objective-name>-implementation-plan.md`. The output file shouls follow the formatting guidelines below.

# Formatting Guidelines

- Use markdown formatting (headings, lists, code blocks)
- Be specific and detailed
- Use actual names, paths, and specifications (not placeholders like "your_file_name_here")
- Include code blocks for schemas, configurations, and file structures
- Ensure every task is actionable without requiring additional decisions
- Maximize information density - remove redundancy, use concise language
- Each section should provide unique value

# Critical Reminders

- Make ALL decisions during planning - leave NOTHING to implementor's discretion
- Be specific about tools, versions, formats, conventions
- Anticipate questions and answer them preemptively
- The final plan shows only selected options (alternatives go in scratchpad only)
- Optimize for information density while maintaining complete detail
- The plan must enable mechanical execution without guessing

Begin your work in the scratchpad, then provide the complete implementation plan saved as a markdown file in the `./memory-bank ` directory with the name `<objective-name>-implementation-plan.md`. This file should only consist of the implementation plan should not duplicate or rehash any of the deliberation, option evaluation, or preliminary planning work you did in the thinking block.
