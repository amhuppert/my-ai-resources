Your task is to update the project brief based on the current directory structure and existing project information.

First, review the following information:

1. Current directory tree:
   <directory_tree>
   !`code-tree $ARGUMENTS`
   </directory_tree>

2. Existing project brief:
   <existing_brief_location>
   @memory-bank/project-brief.md
   </existing_brief_location>

Instructions:

1. Analyze the directory tree and existing project brief.
2. Use the Agent/Task tool to conduct parallel research on the project structure. Create separate tasks analyzing each directory.
3. Wait for all tasks to complete, then collect and merge their findings.
4. Based on the merged findings, create or update the project brief to ensure it is fully up-to-date.
5. Include a directory tree in the updated brief, augmented with terse, one-line descriptions of each directory.

Before providing the updated project brief, in <project_analysis> tags inside your thinking block:

- List out the key directories and files from the directory tree.
- Quote relevant sections from the existing project brief.
- Compare the directory structure with the existing brief to identify any discrepancies.
- Summarize the findings from the Agent/Task tool research.
- Brainstorm potential updates or additions to the brief based on your findings.

This will help ensure a thorough understanding of the project structure.
