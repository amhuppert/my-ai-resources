# General Code Standards

## Control Flow

- Prefer early returns over nested conditionals for readability.

## Code Comments

- You MUST NEVER add commends without considering whether the comment is actually needed.
- When changing code, never document the old behavior or the behavior change (the reader only cares about the CURRENT state)
- NEVER add comments explaining that something is "improved", "better", "new", "enhanced", or referencing what it used to be
- If you're refactoring, remove old comments - don't add new ones explaining the refactoring
- YOU MUST NEVER remove code comments unless you can PROVE they are actively false. Comments are important documentation and must be preserved.
- YOU MUST NEVER refer to temporal context in comments (like "recently refactored" "moved") or code. Comments should be evergreen and describe the code as it is. If you name something "new" or "enhanced" or "improved", you've probably made a mistake and MUST STOP and ask me what to do.

Only comment when code cannot convey the information:

- Why approach was chosen over alternatives
- Business constraints/requirements
- Non-obvious gotchas or edge cases
- Complex algorithms requiring explanation

<example type="invalid">
```ts
// Get the role for this account from the session
const role = session.accountMappings[accountId];
```
❌ Restates what code already shows clearly.
</example>

<example type="valid">
```ts
// Intentionally delay 2s - Stripe webhook arrives before DB commit completes
await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 2000));
```
✅ Explains constraint impossible to know from code alone
</example>

## Designing Software

- YAGNI. The best code is no code. Don't add features we don't need right now.
- When it doesn't conflict with YAGNI, architect for extensibility and flexibility.
- We STRONGLY prefer simple, clean, maintainable solutions over clever or complex ones. Readability and maintainability are PRIMARY CONCERNS, even at the cost of conciseness or performance.
- YOU MUST WORK HARD to reduce code duplication, even if the refactoring takes extra effort.
- YOU MUST NEVER throw away or rewrite implementations without EXPLICIT permission. If you're considering this, YOU MUST STOP and ask first.
- YOU MUST get Alex's explicit approval before implementing ANY backward compatibility.
