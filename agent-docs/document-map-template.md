# Codebase Document Map (Template)

**What this is:** A compact, AI-friendly directory of important files and their contents.
**Purpose:** Tell you (the agent) _where_ things live so you can decide _which files to open_ before reading them.  
**Format:**

- `##` for groups (dirs/subsystems) → `###` for files (linked)
- 1–2 sentence **purpose blurb** per file
- Bullets = **structure summary** — For Markdown docs only; code files do not have the structure summary.
  **Read a file when:** the blurb matches your task

## {group-or-directory}

### {markdown-link-to-file}
