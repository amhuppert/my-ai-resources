# CLAUDE.md File Standards

These are meta-instructions for creating instructions/guidance for AI Agents.
When to use: when creating or editing a CLAUDE.md file or any other file intended for AI Agent consumption.

- Use document references instead of one giant file; essentially have CLAUDE.md point to other docs or files for detailed info, which Claude can fetch as needed. This keeps the primary context lean.
