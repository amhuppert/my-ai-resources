# AI-Optimized Mermaid State Diagrams

## Context
- When creating state diagrams for AI consumption and workflow documentation
- When documenting system states, decision trees, or process flows
- When replacing external documentation with self-contained diagrams

## Requirements
- Use comprehensive inline comments (`%% comment`) throughout diagram
- Add header comments explaining diagram purpose, scope, and key rules
- Document each state with purpose, constraints, and critical rules
- Include transition explanations with context and requirements
- Replace external notes with embedded comments for self-contained diagrams
- Use hierarchical comment structure for logical information grouping
- Provide descriptive transition labels with explanations
- Include critical constraints and business rules as comments

<example type="valid">
```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    %% Purpose: Define user authentication workflow
    %% Key Rule: Security validation required at each step
    %% Critical: Failed attempts trigger lockout after 3 tries

    %% Initial state - all users start unauthenticated
    [*] --> Unauthenticated : Default state

    %% LOGIN FLOW: Multi-factor authentication required
    %% Purpose: Secure user verification with progressive validation
    state Login {
        %% Sequential authentication steps
        [*] --> ValidateCredentials : Check username/password
        ValidateCredentials --> RequireMFA : Credentials valid, need 2FA
        RequireMFA --> Authenticated : MFA successful
        RequireMFA --> [*] : MFA failed, return to start
    }

    Unauthenticated --> Login : /login command - begin auth process
    Login --> Unauthenticated : /logout command - clear session
```
</example>

<example type="invalid">
```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Unauthenticated
    Unauthenticated --> Login
    Login --> Authenticated
    Authenticated --> [*]

    note right of Login
        User enters credentials
        System validates
        MFA required
    end note
```
This lacks inline comments, purpose documentation, and uses external notes instead of embedded context.
</example>

<critical>
  Self-contained diagrams with embedded context eliminate dependency on external documentation and improve AI parsing efficiency.
