# Memory Bank System

## Context

- AI memory resets between sessions
- Memory Bank provides continuity through structured documentation
- Required for understanding project state and history

## Requirements

- Read ALL memory bank files at task start
- Maintain 2 core files: `project-brief.md` and `focus.md`
- `project-brief.md`: High-level overview, tech stack, key architectural decisions, important commands
- `focus.md`: Current work-in-progress, progress made, remaining tasks
- Update `focus.md` when completing tasks or changing direction
- Document new patterns, decisions, and learnings immediately
- Keep files concise and machine-actionable

## Examples

<example type="valid">
Simplified structure with essential context:
```
memory-bank/
├── project-brief.md    # Overview, stack, architecture, commands
└── focus.md            # Current WIP, progress, remaining tasks
```
Complete context with minimal redundancy.
</example>

<example type="invalid">
```
memory-bank/
└── notes.md            # Everything in one file
```
Lacks structure, making it inefficient to parse and maintain.
</example>

<critical>
  Memory Bank is the ONLY link between sessions. Maintain with precision or lose project context.
