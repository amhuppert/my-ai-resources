# Minimal Standards Documents

## Context

- Project-wide standards and instructions are always added to agent conversation context
- Must be extremely lightweight to minimize token usage in every conversation
- Target: High information density, machine-actionable instructions

## Structure

- Markdown document with headings
- Subheadings may only go two levels deep (e.g., ## Section, ### Subsection)
- Each section consists entirely of bulleted lists
- Each standard/instruction is a single bullet point (1 line)
- Only include examples if they fit inline on the same line as the standard

## Format Template

```markdown
# Project Standards

## Section 1

### Subsection 1.1

- Standard 1
- Standard 2 (e.g., inline example)

### Subsection 1.2

- Standard 3
- Standard 4

## Section 2

- Standard 5
- Standard 6
```

## Content Requirements

- Use imperative language (e.g., "Use X", "Avoid Y", "Never Z")
- Optimize for AI context window efficiency: remove redundancy
- Focus on machine-actionable instructions
- Maintain high information density with minimal tokens
- NEVER include verbose explanations or redundant context
- Keep the file as short as possible without sacrificing impact
- Use emojis if they improve clarity: ❌ (invalid, bad), ✅ (valid, good)

<example type="valid">
✅ Use TypeScript for all new code
✅ Avoid console.log in production (use logger.info instead)
</example>

<example type="invalid">
❌ When writing new code, it's important to remember that we should be using TypeScript because it provides type safety
❌ You should avoid using console.log statements in production code. Instead, we recommend using the logger.info method from our logging library for better observability
</example>
