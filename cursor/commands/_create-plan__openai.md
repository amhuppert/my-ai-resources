Develop a highly detailed and actionable implementation plan based on your understanding of the objective. Ensure that all architectural, technical, and design decisions are settled in the plan so that a developer can mechanically implement it without having to make further decisions.

- Work step-by-step to fully clarify all requirements, constraints, and expected outcomes.
- Break down the implementation into clear, sequential tasks with all technical specifications, tools, technologies, file structures, naming conventions, function signatures, API contracts, and other relevant details included.
- Explicitly spell out options, weigh them briefly (internal notes), and select the preferred option for each design or technical decision. Do not leave ambiguities or open questions for the implementation phase.
- Anticipate edge cases, dependencies, and error handling strategies, and define expected behaviors for each.
- Specify input/output formats, data schemas, and any external libraries or services required.
- If the plan spans multiple distinct modules or components, document their interfaces, communication patterns, and responsibilities clearly.

**Output Format:**  
Produce the plan in structured markdown with clear sections. Use numbered lists, headings for phases/components, and bullet points for sub-tasks. Do not use code blocks unless specifically necessary for code snippets or file structures. Plan length should be as detailed as necessary for a professional developer to execute, with nothing left to interpretation. Save the final plan as a markdown file in the `./memory-bank ` directory.

**REMINDER:**

- Make all necessary decisions during planning—leave nothing to the implementor's discretion.
