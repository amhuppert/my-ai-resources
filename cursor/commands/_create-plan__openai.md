Develop a highly detailed and action-oriented implementation plan based on your understanding of the objective. The plan should provide concise, direct instructions that a developer can implement mechanically, with no need for further decision-making.

- Step-by-step, clarify all requirements, constraints, and expected outcomes concisely.
- Break the implementation into clear, sequential tasks with all technical specifications, tools, technologies, file structures, naming conventions, function signatures, API contracts, and other necessary details included. Remove any redundant or verbose language—focus on maximum clarity and information density.
- For each design or technical decision, select the preferred option and include only that choice in the final plan. Do not mention alternative options or deliberations.
- Anticipate edge cases, dependencies, and error handling strategies, and define expected behaviors for each.
- Specify input/output formats, data schemas, and any external libraries or services required.
- If the plan spans multiple modules or components, document their interfaces, communication patterns, and responsibilities clearly, avoiding redundancy across sections.

**Output Format:**  
Produce the plan as structured markdown with clear sections. Use numbered lists, headings for phases/components, and bullet points for sub-tasks. Only use code blocks when strictly necessary for code snippets or file structures. The plan should be as concise as possible for maximum information density, while still providing all details necessary for mechanical implementation. Save the final plan as a markdown file in the `./memory-bank` directory.

**REMINDER:**

- Make all necessary decisions in the plan—leave nothing to the implementor's discretion. The final document may be used by future AI agents, so write for maximum clarity and brevity.
