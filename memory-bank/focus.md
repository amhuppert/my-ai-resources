# Current Focus

Installation scripts have been successfully ported from Bash to TypeScript.

## Completed

✓ Created `typescript/lib/installer-utils.ts` with core utility functions for file operations, backups, and CLAUDE.md merging
✓ Ported `install-user.sh` → `typescript/scripts/install-user.ts` with all 7 installation steps
✓ Ported `install-project.sh` → `typescript/scripts/install-project.ts` with all installation steps
✓ Updated `package.json` build configuration to compile new scripts
✓ Removed old bash scripts (`install-user.sh`, `install-project.sh`, `lib/helpers.sh`)
✓ Created new TypeScript entry points (`install-user.ts`, `install-project.ts`)
✓ Tested project-level installation successfully

## Key Implementation Details

- Used Bun.spawn() for subprocess execution (rsync, git, claude, bun)
- Preserved exact backup naming convention (`__YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.bk`)
- Maintained same rsync flags for consistency
- Added proper TypeScript type safety throughout
- Compiled executables work standalone in `typescript/dist/`

## Next Steps

- Update documentation if needed to reference new TypeScript installation scripts
- Consider whether to add integration tests for installation process
